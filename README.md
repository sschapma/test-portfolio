* This is the portfolio for the full stack web developer, Sam Chapman. It includes a short bio, some projects, contact info and links to social media sites.

* I am currently for hire, and actively seeking full time employment. I prefer to work in the South-Eastern USA (Raleigh-Durham, Atlanta, Greenville, etc.) but I am open to the right opportunity anywhere in the country. If you are interested in my work and would like to talk further, please don't hesitate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you!
